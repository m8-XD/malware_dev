# Maldev
Here I will store all code I've been writing during malware development learning.

# Note:
I didn't just copied all the code, I've been reading documentation and blogs to understand and create that code.

Each subsection will contain its README, so you can read more about every subproject.

# LEGAL
If YOU will try to use any of this programs on computers you don't have permission to run a malware on, only YOU will be charged.
All programs I pushed here are made in educational purpose, it means that every program can be easilly detected with almost any scanner or anti-virus program.
